The technology i decided to use in this project is called Blazor. Blazor simply allow us to build an interactive UIs using C# instead of JavaScript.
It also allow us to write not only client but also and server side code. The general purpose of this project is to display information about products
in online shop. The products which are been displayed, we are getting from a separate JSON file. The main componets of this project are the Controllers
folder, Models folder, Resources folder and Views folder. In the Controllers folder we have our HomeControler.cs wich acts like a middleman between the 
Model and the View. In the MOdels folder we have our Product.cs file which we are using to get our products from the JSON file located in the Resources
folder. And last in the Views folder there is the Home subfolder with the Index.cshtml. Here present the result to the user.
